- Next, you will read the code and in the line 15 there are two base64 strings include: **"YWRtaW4"** and **"cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ"**, it can be the username and password so I will open the terminal and decode it.

**Step 3** : Open the terminal and decode two base64 strings

I will use these commands to decode the string:

**`echo "YWRtaW4" | base64 --decode`**

- Which the string **"YWRtaW4"** after decoding it, I find the username is "admin"
